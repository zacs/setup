# Machine setup

This is my personal machine setup.

It has used complicated frameworks like Ansible and boxen in the past. Those seem like overkill these days. 

### Set up

To run the scripts remotely, just do (for example):

    $ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacs/setup/master/.macos | sh

Things to do that aren't scripted here:
- Keys
- Install Homebrew
- Setup Hyper key with Karabiner
- Install Terminal colors
- zshrc + theme

`/etc` contains some shit to achieve the above.
